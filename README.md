# SQIR
A **S**mall **Q**uantum **I**ntermediate **R**epresentation for a verified compiler.

## Compilation Instructions

Run `make` to compile the files in the core directory, `make optimizer` to compile code in the optimizer directory, `make mapper` to compile code in the mapper directory, and `make examples` to compile the code in the examples directory. Use `make all` to compile everything.

The development has been tested with Coq versions 8.9.1. On a standard laptop, `make all` takes about an hour.

## Directory Contents

### core

- core/SQIR.v : General definition of the SQIR language.
- core/UnitarySem.v : Semantics for unitary SQIR programs.
- core/DensitySem.v : Density matrix semantics for general SQIR programs.
- core/NDSem.v : Non-deterministic semantics for general SQIR programs.
- core/Utilities.v : Utilities for describing composition of SQIR programs and classical state vectors.

We also rely on several files from the [QWIRE](https://github.com/inQWIRE/QWIRE) development.

### optimizer

Current progress on a verified optimizer for SQIR programs.

- Utilities
  - optimizer/Equivalences.v : Verified circuit equivalences useful for peephole optimizations.
  - optimizer/ListRepresentation.v : List representation of unitary and non-unitary SQIR programs.
  - optimizer/PI4GateSet.v : Fixed gate set used in our optimizer. 

- Optimizations on unitary programs
  - optimizer/GateCancellation.v : Cancel gates adjacent to their inverses, propagate using the rules from Nam et al.
  - optimizer/HadamardReduction.v : 'Hadamard reduction' pass from Nam et al.
  - optimizer/NotPropagation.v : Based on the 'not propagation' preprocessing step from Nam et al.
  - optimizer/RotationMerging.v : 'Rotation merging using phase polynomials' optimization from Nam et al.

- Optimizations on non-unitary programs
  - optimizer/RemoveZRotationBeforeMeasure.v : Remove single-qubit z-axis rotations before measurement operations.
  - optimizer/PropagateClassical.v : Track classical states to remove redundant measurements and CNOT operations.

### mapper

Mapping algorithms for SQIR programs.

- mapper/SimpleMapping.v: Simple mapping for an architecture described by a directed graph.
